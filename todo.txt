TODO list for test game

Have a simple inventory screen with a 3x3 grid layout.
Implement the action of planting seeds from inventory, watering plant and picking the flowers.
Combat mechanic to battle flies, mice, and birds
Points for scoring and leveling the character and enemies. Not too concerned with leveling the map, but it will help in any future games. 
Saving and Loading game files would just be a nice feature to learn about.

For the sake of keeping the code simple, and for ease of memory/documentation, I think the following commands will be useful -
        space bar - attack or swat enemies
        'p' key - plant a seed
        'w' key - water a plant
        'h' key - harvest a flower
        'i' key - to open and close inventory screen
        The arrow keys to move around

probably forgot a couple of things, but this is the bulk of it.
